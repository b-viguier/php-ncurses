# php-ncurses

Php [FFI](https://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.ffi.php) bindings for [`ncurses`](https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/) library.
(:warning: proof of concept)

Examples come from https://tldp.org/HOWTO/NCURSES-Programming-HOWTO/index.html

:warning: I tried to modify original example as less as possible, that's why some parts of the code may look _unusual_ to a Php developer.
